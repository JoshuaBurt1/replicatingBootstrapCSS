<!--
1.) Review the following layout examples featured on https://
getbootstrap.com/ :
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/  - REFERENCE WEBPAGE
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/product/
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/blog/
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/

2.) Using either Flexbox or Grid (or a combination of both), recreate the
featured layout without Bootstrap. To do so, you will need to create both the
HTML and CSS files. You may work independently or collaborate with a
partner in order to complete this assignment.

3.) Publish your page using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
